# Spreadsheet for Monthly Budgeting

This is a simple budget spreadsheet that takes inputs such as income, expenses, loans, and investments to help
a user visualize their spending.

## Use Notes:
- Input your income, expenses, and more
- Use button cells for certain financials to navigate to specific sheets with more detailed breakdowns and
  visualizations
- Add and adjust for your own expense categories

## Background
I created this spreadsheet to have a personalized breakdown of my financials with no unnecessary categories and only
clean visuals. I also used it to learn some simple Excel macros like navigation button cells as well as how to lock/unlock
cells based on whether they should be changed. I learned about Form and ActiveX controls after making this spreadsheet so I 
hope to make better use of those, instead, in the future.
