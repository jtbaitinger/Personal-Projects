# Trivia Scoreboard Using PowerPoint

I created this simple PowerPoint tool (Trivia Board.pptm) for keeping track of the score and power-up use for team vs. team trivia games.
## Use Notes:
- The trivia host can paste up to 20 questions on the last slide.
- The first slide should be the only slide displayed, and the left/right arrow buttons scroll through the questions
- You must click "Start" in presentation mode after inputting the questions to lock the questions into the scroll system
- The question slide must stay as the last slide in the presentation for the code to work
- The three power-up icons can be replaced to fit game rules
- Team logos can be pasted onto either side of the "VS." text
- Buttons will only work on Windows

## Background
I made this project to teach myself VBA code with the goal of using this scoreboard for a Zoom trivia league. The host shares
their screen for each game so players can follow along with the questions and scoring. I learned how to use ActiveX controls
in PowerPoint (the interactive buttons) and how to edit their code.
